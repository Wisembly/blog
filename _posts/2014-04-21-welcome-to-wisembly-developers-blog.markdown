Hi there!

During the last 3 years, here, at Wisembly, we strove to make the best code possible and the more robust web solution for our beloved clients.

Open source in mind, we relased some of our work, with [Elephant.io][elephant] or [ExcelAnt][excelant] for example.

Here, we'll try to share useful snippets and share some tech discovers we made during our awesome journey.

Enjoy and have fun!
